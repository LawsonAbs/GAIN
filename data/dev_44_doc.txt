The memogate controversy ( also Mullen memo controversy ) revolves around a memorandum ( addressed to Admiral Mike Mullen ) ostensibly seeking help of the Obama administration in the wake of the Osama bin Laden raid to avert a military takeover of the civilian government in Pakistan , as well as assisting in a civilian takeover of the government and military apparatus . The memo was delivered in May 2011 ; Mansoor Ijaz wrote a Financial Times article in October 2011 bringing initial public attention to the affair . The memo , which at first was questioned to even exist , was published in November , leading to the resignation of Ambassador Haqqani and the continuing Pakistani Supreme Court investigation . Central actors in the plot include Pakistani - American businessman Mansoor Ijaz , who alleged that long - time friend and former Pakistan Ambassador to the United States Husain Haqqani asked him to deliver a confidential memo asking for US assistance . The memo is alleged to have been drafted by Haqqani at the behest of President of Pakistan Asif Ali Zardari . The memo was delivered to Mike Mullen through then National Security Advisor James L. Jones . The Supreme Court of Pakistan has opened a broader inquiry into the origins , credibility and purpose of the memo . On 19 April 2012 a petition was submitted in the Supreme Court to arrest former Pakistan ambassador to US Husain Haqqani through Interpol for his refusal to return to Pakistan . On 12 June the supreme court commission released its findings and found that after testimony by all parties and verifying the forensic results of Ijaz 's BlackBerry conversations with Haqqani it was " incontrovertibly established " that Husain Haqqani had written the memo and was being called back to Pakistan to face likely charges of treason .
