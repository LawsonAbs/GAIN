0 Jonas Geirnaert ( born July 28 , 1982 ) studied animation at the KASK in Ghent .
1 In May 2004 he won the Short Film Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival with his animated short Flatlife ( 11 min ) .
2 Of the copy he sent in for selection only the first minute had sound .
3 This is because this was his graduation project , and it was n't completely finished at the final date for selection entries .
4 Although Flatlife has no political message , Jonas ' previous movie , The All - American Alphabet , clearly has one .
5 On stage in Cannes , Jonas had a message for all Americans : " Do n't vote Bush " .
6 At that moment such statements were very popular , however his political preference has to be situated in the extreme - left corner as he is a militant for the marxist party Workers Party of Belgium .
7 In the fall of 2005 Geirnaert made the TV comedy series Neveneffecten for Canvas ( public Flemish television ) with his fellow comedians Lieven Scheire , Koen De Poorter and Jelle De Beule .
8 In 2011 this same group of four made the television show BASTA which also offered satirical critique on current cultural phenomenon , like help desks , uncritical journalism , television call games , the production of meat and internet scammers .
9 Through their actions some of the more fraudulent abuses have been put to a stop , e.g.
10 the de facto illegal television calling games have been banned from television in Flanders .
